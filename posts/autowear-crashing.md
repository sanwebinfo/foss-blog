Autowear Latest Update 3.2.13 crashing and Stop Working.

<!--more-->

## Reasons

Developer Just update the issues related to crashing  and not starting up on the Reddit forum

**Check** - [Autowear Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tasker/comments/18goshf/dev_autowear_3213_is_finally_out_on_google_play/?rdt=37998){#external}

Many users facing this issue.
This morning I Just updated the app on Both My Mobile and Watch after the update I can't access the Autowear actions on the watch also Screen fetching is not working in Autowear Mobile app.
later I searched about this issue on Reddit and found the developer's post about this issue and update.

Kindly don't update the app from the Play Store wait for some time to get the patched version or dowload the Patched APK directly and update it.

**it's fixed now** Update the latest version from Google play store.
